# User Flows & Value-Driven Features

To maximize the "AI-native" potential for a second brain, the flows must minimize friction while maximizing synthesis (connecting ideas).

## 1. The "Capture" Flow (New Note)
*The goal: Move from fleeting thought to structured knowledge instantly without breaking the flow.*

*   **Step 1: The Intent Modulation (The Modal)**
    *   **User Action:** User clicks "New."
    *   **System Response:** Instead of a blank screen, a modal asks: "Is this a **Journal Entry** (Time-based, emotional, ephemeral) or a **Knowledge Note** (Timeless, interlinkable, permanent)?"
    *   **Value:** This separates the "Collector" (Journal) from the "Connector" (Second Brain) immediately, allowing the AI to treat the data differently (mood analysis vs. semantic linking).

*   **Step 2: Contextual Ingestion**
    *   **User Action:** Inputs title and pastes a URL (original source).
    *   **AI Action:** The AI automatically reads the link, generates a summary, extracts key quotes, and suggests tags.
    *   **Value:** Saves the user 15 minutes of reading and summarizing. The note starts populated, not empty.

*   **Step 3: The Smart Template**
    *   **User Action:** Picks a template (e.g., "Literature Note," "Daily Standup," "Idea Capture").
    *   **Feature:** **Dynamic Prompts.** If the user picks "Literature Note," the AI inserts a "Key Takeaway" section. If "Journal," it inserts "Gratitude" and "Daily Stressors."

## 2. The "Synthesis" Flow (The Editor)
*The goal: Improve the quality of writing and thinking in real-time.*

*   **Feature: The Insight Quality Tracker**
    *   **Implementation:** A side panel analyzing text structure.
    *   **Value:** Instead of just grammar, it measures **"Cognitive Density"** (how many unique, complex ideas are present) and **"Actionability"** (does the note contain next steps?). This gamifies writing better essays and articles.

*   **Feature: The Serendipity Engine (Linking)**
    *   **Implementation:** As the user types, the AI highlights keywords that match *older* notes.
    *   **Value:** It solves the "Zettelkasten problem" where users forget to link ideas. It forces the Second Brain to grow connections automatically.

## 3. The "Reflection" Flow (Home Dashboard)
*The goal: Encourage review and habit formation.*

*   **Feature: The Weekly AI Briefing**
    *   **Implementation:** Not just a list of notes, but a generated paragraph: *"You wrote mostly about 'Productivity' and 'Anxiety' this week. Your mood stabilized mid-week."*
    *   **Value:** Turns raw data into wisdom. It helps the user see patterns they might miss.

*   **Feature: Mood vs. Productivity Correlation**
    *   **Implementation:** A chart overlaying the "Mood Pattern" with the "Number of High-Quality Notes Created."
    *   **Value:** Helps the user understand their personal working conditions (e.g., "I write better when I'm calm, not when I'm manic").

# The Distilled Product Report

Here is the highly distilled summary focusing on problem, solution, and impact.

## Section 1: Intro to the Problem
Current digital note-taking suffers from **"Data Fragmentation" and "Creation Friction."**
Knowledge workers and journal enthusiasts store their fleeting thoughts (journals) and their permanent knowledge (notes) in separate silos. This disconnect prevents users from correlating their emotional state with their intellectual output. Furthermore, maintaining a "Second Brain" requires heavy manual labor—tagging, linking, and summarizing—that most users abandon within weeks. The result is a digital graveyard of disconnected text where insights are buried and forgotten, leading to a loss of personal history and wasted creative potential.

## Section 2: Our Proposed Solution
We propose **"Cognitive Sync,"** a unified, AI-native workspace that bridges the gap between personal reflection (Journaling) and knowledge management (Second Brain).
By treating Markdown as a structured data layer, our AI functions as an active research assistant rather than a passive storage bucket. The system actively synthesizes weekly summaries, suggests bi-directional links between old and new ideas, and provides real-time feedback on writing quality. We remove the barrier to entry by auto-populating context from external sources and guiding the user through intent-based flows, ensuring that every piece of information is captured, contextualized, and connected without friction.

## Section 3: What the Product Is
**The Product** is a modern, markdown-based, AI-native operating system for personal growth and intelligence.

*   **The Dashboard (The Mirror):** A view into the user's mind, featuring streaks for habit formation, mood trend analysis, and AI-generated weekly summaries that correlate emotional well-being with creative output.
*   **The Smart Capture (The Gateway):** A tiered entry flow that distinguishes between ephemeral journals and permanent notes, utilizing AI to ingest source links and pre-fill structured templates.
*   **The Living Editor (The Engine):** A writing environment that features a "Quality Tracker" to gamify high-density writing and a "Serendipity Engine" that automatically suggests connections to past notes, effectively building the Second Brain on autopilot.
*   **Semantic Search (The Retrieval):** A keyword-agnostic search that understands concepts, allowing users to find ideas based on "vibe" or context rather than exact matches.
