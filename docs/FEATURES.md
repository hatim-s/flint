# Core Functionality and Features Guidelines

The following section details the core functionalities of the product. This guideline establishes the "core underlying thought" behind every feature, ensuring future decisions remain aligned with the vision of value creation and user-centric utility.

## 1. Home Page: The Cognitive Dashboard
**What the feature is:** A dynamic, unified landing page displaying four key modules: Mood/Emotion Pattern Trends, Calendar/Streak Overview, Recent Notes, and a Weekly Summary.
**Core Underlying Thought:** The app should not just be a directory of files, but a mirror of the user's life. The home page provides immediate context, bridging the gap between "how I feel" and "what I am working on."
**Impact on User:**
*   **Self-Awareness:** Visualizing emotional trends helps users identify triggers and patterns in their well-being.
*   **Motivation:** Streak counters and visual calendars gamify consistency, encouraging the habit of daily engagement.
*   **Resumption:** Immediate access to recent notes and a weekly summary reduces the time needed to "context switch" back into work, providing a sense of accomplishment and direction.

## 2. Smart Capture and Modal Creation Flow
**What the feature is:** A structured modal for creating new entries that distinguishes between "Journal" and "Note" types. It includes steps for naming, adding original source links, and selecting templates.
**Core Underlying Thought:** Capture must be swift but structured enough to be useful later. We must reduce the friction of the "blank page" while ensuring essential metadata is captured at the point of entry.
**Impact on User:**
*   **Organization:** Pre-emptive metadata entry ensures the second brain remains searchable and organized from day one.
*   **Focus:** Templates provide immediate structure, allowing the user to focus on content creation rather than formatting.
*   **Intent clarity:** Distinguishing between a "Journal" and a "Note" allows the app to apply context-specific AI tools (e.g., mood tracking for journals, tagging for notes) automatically.

## 3. Markdown-First Rich Text Editor
**What the feature is:** A distraction-free, lightweight Markdown editor supporting standard syntax (headings, lists, links) and live preview.
**Core Underlying Thought:** The interface must respect the user's flow. Markdown is the universal language of developers and writers, offering portability and speed without the bloat of heavy word processors.
**Impact on User:**
*   **Speed & Fluency:** Users can write and format without touching a mouse, maintaining a state of "flow."
*   **Portability:** Markdown ensures data ownership; users can export their thoughts to any text editor, preventing vendor lock-in.
*   **Focus:** A clean interface minimizes cognitive load, allowing the user's ideas to take center stage.

## 4. AI-Augmented "Live Trackers" Sidebar
**What the feature is:** A collapsible sidebar within the editor that provides real-time feedback, including "Text Quality" (readability, grammar) and "Mood" logging (inferred or manual).
**Core Underlying Thought:** The AI should act as a gentle coach, not a judge. It should provide value *during* the creation process, not just after.
**Impact on User:**
*   **Skill Development:** Real-time quality feedback helps users refine their writing and thinking skills instantly.
*   **Emotional Integration:** Logging mood alongside content creates a rich dataset that links specific projects or topics to the user's emotional state, revealing insights like "I write better when calm."
*   **Reduced Friction:** Mood logging becomes part of the writing flow rather than a separate, tedious chore.

## 5. Intelligent Search and Discovery
**What the feature is:** A semantic search engine that understands context and intent, rather than just matching keywords. Includes filters for tags, note types, date, and mood.
**Core Underlying Thought:** A second brain is only as good as its retrievability. The user should be able to find "what I was thinking about X when I felt Y" without effort.
**Impact on User:**
*   **Efficiency:** Semantic search saves time by surfacing relevant notes even if the exact keywords aren't present.
*   **Serendipity:** Context-aware results can surface forgotten or related notes, sparking new connections and ideas.
*   **Targeted Reflection:** Filtering by mood allows users to review decisions made during specific emotional states, aiding in self-analysis and emotional intelligence.

## 6. AI-Suggested Templates and Tagging
**What the feature is:** The system proactively suggests note templates (e.g., Meeting Notes, Project Plan) and relevant tags based on the user's current context (time, calendar events, content).
**Core Underlying Thought:** The AI should anticipate needs to reduce cognitive load. Organizational structure should be a byproduct of capture, not a prerequisite.
**Impact on User:**
*   **Consistency:** Automated tagging ensures a clean, searchable taxonomy without manual effort.
*   **Workflow Acceleration:** Context-aware templates remove the setup time for new entries, allowing for instant capture of thoughts.
*   **Knowledge Graphing:** Consistent tagging allows the AI to build a more accurate web of connections between disparate notes.

## 7. Data Privacy, Security, and Export
**What the feature is:** Robust encryption for data at rest and in transit, transparent AI policies, and easy export tools for standard Markdown files.
**Core Underlying Thought:** A second brain contains a user's most private self. Trust is the non-negotiable foundation of the product. The user must own their mind.
**Impact on User:**
*   **Trust & Safety:** Users are more likely to be vulnerable and honest in their journaling if they know their data is secure and private.
*   **Freedom:** The ability to easily export data eliminates the fear of being locked into the platform, encouraging long-term adoption.
*   **Agency:** Clear transparency about AI usage empowers the user to make informed decisions about their digital footprint.
