# User Flows & Value-Driven Features

To maximize the "AI-native" potential for a second brain, the flows must minimize friction while maximizing synthesis (connecting ideas).

## 1. The "Capture" Flow (New Note)
*The goal: Move from fleeting thought to structured knowledge instantly without breaking the flow.*

*   **Step 1: The Intent Modulation (The Modal)**
    *   **User Action:** User clicks "New."
    *   **System Response:** Instead of a blank screen, a modal asks: "Is this a **Journal Entry** (Time-based, emotional, ephemeral) or a **Knowledge Note** (Timeless, interlinkable, permanent)?"
    *   **Value:** This separates the "Collector" (Journal) from the "Connector" (Second Brain) immediately, allowing the AI to treat the data differently (mood analysis vs. semantic linking).

*   **Step 2: Contextual Ingestion**
    *   **User Action:** Inputs title and pastes a URL (original source).
    *   **AI Action:** The AI automatically reads the link, generates a summary, extracts key quotes, and suggests tags.
    *   **Value:** Saves the user 15 minutes of reading and summarizing. The note starts populated, not empty.

*   **Step 3: The Smart Template**
    *   **User Action:** Picks a template (e.g., "Literature Note," "Daily Standup," "Idea Capture").
    *   **Feature:** **Dynamic Prompts.** If the user picks "Literature Note," the AI inserts a "Key Takeaway" section. If "Journal," it inserts "Gratitude" and "Daily Stressors."

## 2. The "Synthesis" Flow (The Editor)
*The goal: Improve the quality of writing and thinking in real-time.*

*   **Feature: The Insight Quality Tracker**
    *   **Implementation:** A side panel analyzing text structure.
    *   **Value:** Instead of just grammar, it measures **"Cognitive Density"** (how many unique, complex ideas are present) and **"Actionability"** (does the note contain next steps?). This gamifies writing better essays and articles.

*   **Feature: The Serendipity Engine (Linking)**
    *   **Implementation:** As the user types, the AI highlights keywords that match *older* notes.
    *   **Value:** It solves the "Zettelkasten problem" where users forget to link ideas. It forces the Second Brain to grow connections automatically.

## 3. The "Reflection" Flow (Home Dashboard)
*The goal: Encourage review and habit formation.*

*   **Feature: The Weekly AI Briefing**
    *   **Implementation:** Not just a list of notes, but a generated paragraph: *"You wrote mostly about 'Productivity' and 'Anxiety' this week. Your mood stabilized mid-week."*
    *   **Value:** Turns raw data into wisdom. It helps the user see patterns they might miss.

*   **Feature: Mood vs. Productivity Correlation**
    *   **Implementation:** A chart overlaying the "Mood Pattern" with the "Number of High-Quality Notes Created."
    *   **Value:** Helps the user understand their personal working conditions (e.g., "I write better when I'm calm, not when I'm manic").
